"""
Lyrics alignment - lyrics text from a lyrics database + word timings from Whisper.

The database (LRCLIB) has the right words but at best line-level timing, often for the
album version rather than the downloaded video. Whisper has accurate word timings on the
vocals stem but mishears words. Aligning the two word sequences gives the database text
with Whisper's timings; words Whisper missed are placed between their matched neighbours.
